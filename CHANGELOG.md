## [2016.07] - 2016-07-07
- Code changes in rf_client.py, It is now a script that is used to setup the tool for any given sut (system under test)
- Added schema.py with schemamodel class to serialize/parse schema files into appropriate structures representing CSDL elements used for section 6 and 7 assertions. Added search functions for these structures
- Retrieved relative uris (nested resources) starting from service root so the scope of assertions can be expanded to run on all the resources exposed by the service

- Refactored classes/functions for more flexible usage 
- Created a seperate class for sut and log (rf_sut.py and logger.py). rf_sut also serves as an API for rf_utililty which does more HTTP related work under the hood 
- Updated log to generate a new excel result file everyone tool runs according to date time stamp
- Created assertion test files for each section of the redfish specification in rfs_test
- Added a sample_run file to demonstrate how the tool runs - Added Redfish Service Check Tool Help document to demonstrate use of tool's modules and their functionalities via python command line or code/script

## [2016.04] - 2016-04-12
